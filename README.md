## Fast Food

### App Description
Allows college students and people living in the area to order food on the go. A major issue for college students is not being able to eat meals as there are days where they have classes all day. This app will allow them to order a meal from a foodtruck near their lecture hall 10 minutes before lecture ends and pick it up on the way to their next class, securing them a meal for the day.

### App Idea Evaluation
- Mobile: Mobile is a key component of this application as the availability and variety of trucks depends on where you are and what tine it is. The user's location and some type of mapping system will be essential to making ordering food more convenient and accessible.
- Story: Enables students to try new food trucks in the area and increases business for said trucks. Students will be able to quickly and easily order food in between classes. This app idea would be incredibly valuable on an especially busy day for a student who is bouncing between classes and extracurriculars.
- Market: While anybody could benefit from ordering food on the go, this app in particular would serve college students and city residents especially well. 
- Habit: The average user would most likely use this app a couple of times during the week as an alternative to taking the time to cook a meal. Students, professionals and city residents are using this throughout the day for meals or quick snacks.
- Scope: V1 would most likely encompass food trucks surrounding the group's home university/city (Drexel University/Philadelphia). Would include a list of trucks operating in the area as well as menus, prices and basic read/write features to facilitate communication between consumers and food truck owners. Though relatively stripped down, V1 would still be interesting to create. V2 would include real time location, the potential for a rewards system and the abillity for owners to indicate whether or not they're out of a certain item.

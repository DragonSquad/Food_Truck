## Fast Food

### App Description
Allows college students and people living in the area to order food on the go. A major issue for college students is not being able to eat meals as there are days where they have classes all day. This app will allow them to order a meal from a foodtruck near their lecture hall 10 minutes before lecture ends and pick it up on the way to their next class, securing them a meal for the day.
